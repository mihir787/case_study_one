```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

From initial review of the information provided we will show how many breweries are present within each state.

```{r BreweriesReview}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)

Breweries <- read.csv("Breweries.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ',', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Check City spelling
Breweries <- Breweries[with(Breweries, order(State,City,Name)),]

BreweriesClean <- Breweries
BreweriesClean <- BreweriesClean[with(BreweriesClean, order(Brew_ID)),]

# Misspelled City Names, researched official spelling 
BreweriesClean[c(59,139),3] <- "Saint Paul" 
BreweriesClean[130,3] <- "St. Marys" 
BreweriesClean[68,3] <- "St. Petersburg" 
BreweriesClean[339,3] <- "St. Johns" 
BreweriesClean[c(378,457),3] <- "Menomonie" 
BreweriesClean[69,3] <- "Mount Airy" 
BreweriesClean[385,3] <- "Mount Pleasant" 

# Incorrect State for given City
BreweriesClean[96,4] <- "MI" 

# Check for duplicate Breweries after removing Brewery and Brewing Company
BreweriesClean$BrewDups = BreweriesClean$Name
  
# Remove "Brewery", "Brewing Company", "Brewing", "Beer Co.", 
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, "Brewery", "")
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, "Brewing", "")
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, "Beer", "")
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, "Cider", "")
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, "Company", "")
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, "co.", "")
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- str_replace_all(BreweriesClean$BrewDups, " ", "")

# Convert all characters to lower so we can better find potential duplicates
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- tolower(BreweriesClean$BrewDups)
# Paste Name converted to lower, City, and State for matching duplicates
BreweriesClean <- unite(BreweriesClean, BrewDupsFreq, BrewDups, City, State, sep = ",", remove = FALSE)

# Determine if multiples are present
dupNames <- as.data.frame(table(BreweriesClean$BrewDupsFreq))
dupNames <- subset(dupNames, dupNames$Freq>1)

BreweriesCleanDups <- BreweriesClean[BreweriesClean$BrewDupsFreq %in%  dupNames$Var1,]
BreweriesCleanDups <- BreweriesCleanDups[order(BreweriesCleanDups$BrewDupsFreq),]

# Review results
BreweriesCleanDups

# Fix based on observations and other data discovery
BreweriesClean[2,2] <- "Against The Grain Brewery"
BreweriesClean[147,2] <- "Angrew Minnow Brewing Company"
BreweriesClean[197,2] <- "Goose Island Brewing Company"
BreweriesClean[380,2] <- "Grey Sail Brewing Company"
BreweriesClean[396,2] <- "Hops & Grains Brewing Company"

# Brew_ID with Duplicate Rows: 2 & 63, 89 & 197, 147 & 543, 378 & 457, 59 & 139
BreweriesClean$BrewDupsFreq <- NULL
BreweriesClean$BrewDups <- NULL
```

### Question 1
Count by State, probably  needs to be based on Brewery_Name given the cleaning...

```{r Q1}
# Make use of cleaned data set
BreweryByState <- table(factor(BreweriesClean$State))
BreweryByState <- data.frame(BreweryByState)

# Rename columns to something meaningful
colnames(BreweryByState) <- c('State','Count')

BreweryByState
```

### Question 2
Combine data set into a merged frame

```{r Q2}
# Read in csv file containing Beer details
Beers <- read.csv("Beers.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ',')

# Merge the data on Beers.Brewery_Id and Breweries.Brew_ _ID then validate merged file
df_merge <- merge(Beers, Breweries, by.x="Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID")
head(df_merge)
tail(df_merge)

#Give the columns more meaningful name
# Rename column 'Name' from Beers data
colnames(df_merge)[2] <- "Beer_name"

# Rename column 'Name' from Breweries data
colnames(df_merge)[8] <- "Brewery_name"
names(df_merge)

#Arrange the columns in more meaningful order
df_merge <- df_merge[c("Brewery_id","Brewery_name","Beer_ID","Beer_name",
                       "ABV","IBU","Style","Ounces", "City","State")]


# Show first 6 and last 6 rows of merged data
head(df_merge,6)
tail(df_merge,6)
```

### Question 3

```{r Q3}
CountNA <- colSums(is.na(df_merge))
CountNA <- data.frame(CountNA)
CountNA
```

### Question 4
```{r Q4}
# Remove NA from df_merge
library(ggplot2)
df_merge <- na.omit(df_merge)

# Generate the median of alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each State
df_merge_subset <- data.frame(State=df_merge$State, ABV=df_merge$ABV, IBU=df_merge$IBU)

MedianABV <- tapply(df_merge_subset$ABV,df_merge_subset$State,median)
MedianIBU <- tapply(df_merge_subset$IBU,df_merge_subset$State,median)

# Combine with State
plot_frame <- data.frame(MedianABV, MedianIBU)
plot_frame$State <- rownames(plot_frame)
rownames(plot_frame) <- NULL
plot_frame

# Plot MedianABV by State
ggplot(plot_frame, aes(x=State, y=MedianABV)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', color='black', fill='light blue') +
  xlab("MedianABV") + ylab("State") +
  ggtitle("MedianABV by State") +
  coord_flip()

# Plot MedianIBU by State  
ggplot(plot_frame, aes(x=State, y=MedianIBU)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', color='black', fill='light green') +
  xlab("MedianIBU") + ylab("State") +
  ggtitle("MedianIBU by State") +
  coord_flip()
```

### Question 5

```{r Q5}
# Sort data to determine State with highest ABV
# Largest ABV is .125 within Kentucky
TopABV <- df_merge_subset[order(-df_merge_subset$ABV),]
TopABV <- TopABV[1,1:2]

# Sort data to determine State with highest IBU
# Largest IBU is 138 within Oregan
TopIBU <- df_merge_subset[order(-df_merge_subset$IBU),]
TopIBU <- TopIBU[1,]
TopIBU[,2] <- NULL
TopIBU
```

### Question 6
```{r Q6}
summaryABV <- summary(df_merge_subset$ABV)
summaryABV
```
